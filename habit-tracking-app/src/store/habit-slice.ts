// Habit Interface: Describes what a habit looks like (with id, name, frequency, etc.).
// HabitState Interface: Describes the overall state (a list of habits).
// initialState: Sets up an empty list of habits at the start.
// createSlice: Manages state and actions to add, remove, or update habits.
